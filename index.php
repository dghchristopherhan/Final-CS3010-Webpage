                <h4>Some Useful Advice about Parrying [Versetzen]</h4><hr>
                <p>Therefore note first that there are two types of parrying. The first is when you parry without any particular
                    advantage in the common fashion only out of fear, in which you do nothing but catch the strokes that come
                    from your opponent by holding your weapon against him, and you do not seek to injure him, but are content to
                    get away from him without injury . . .</p>

                <p>And Liechtenauer speaks of this kind of parrying when he says:</p>

                <blockquote>Guard yourself from parrying; <br>
                    if need befalls you, it will cause you trouble.</blockquote>

                <p>With these lines he does not entirely forbid parrying, namely that you should learn how to cut; for as it
                    will harm you (as you have heard before) if you will rely on parrying, since you would be compelled to parry
                    too much . . .</p>

                <p>The second way to parry is when you parry your opponent and hit him at the same time with a single stroke,
                    which the combat masters of old especially praise as suitable. Hence, the proverb has arisen: 'A true
                    combatant doesn't parry, but when the opponent cuts, he cuts too; when the opponent steps, then he steps
                    too; when the opponent thrusts, then he thrusts too.'</p>
